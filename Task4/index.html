    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Sajid, a passionate and curious third-year BTech IT student at Kalasalingam University in Tamil Nadu. My academic journey began at TNC GOVT College Kovur in Nellore District, where I completed my 12th grade.<br>

My fascination with technology fuels my desire to learn and explore. I'm proficient in front-end web development, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create user interfaces. I'm also familiar with Git version control, allowing me to collaborate effectively on projects.<br>

Beyond academics, I actively seek out new knowledge. I enjoy reading articles, staying updated on emerging technologies, and practicing yoga for mind-body balance. Music is a constant companion, keeping me energized and inspired.<br>


My background has significantly shaped my path. Coming from a family where my father is a dedicated government teacher, I value hard work, discipline, and the importance of continuous learning.<br>

Here's a glimpse into some well-regarded AI tools that might interest you:

Large Language Models (LLMs) like me: I can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.
Computer Vision Tools: These can analyze and understand visual content, like recognizing objects in images or videos.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tools: These help computers understand and process human language, enabling applications like chatbots or sentiment analysis.
Machine Learning Tools: These allow computers to learn from data without explicit programming, making them powerful for tasks like image recognition or spam filtering.

      <p>The HTML defines a page with a title, heading ("Tic Tac Toe"), a restart button, and a gameboard containing individual squares.
        The CSS styles the page with an orange color scheme, a custom font, and positions the elements for a clean layout.
        The JavaScript manages the game's core functionality:
        It keeps track of the current player (X or O) and which boxes are filled with which symbol.
        When a box is clicked, the game checks if it's empty and fills it with the current player's symbol.
        The code also checks for winning combinations after each move. If a player wins, the winning squares are highlighted, and the winner is announced in the heading.
        The "Restart" button resets the game to its initial state.</p>
